I am a French mathematician living in Paris. My work stems from algebraic topology and revolves around the concepts of mathematical structure and language. I am currently working to organize and disseminate my results. This page is meant to make my research accessible. I'd be happy to hear any thoughts you might have.

### Interests

Category Theory, Monoidal Structures, $E_n$-structures, Operads, Formalization of mathematics
